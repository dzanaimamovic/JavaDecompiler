- **Supports Various Formats**: Handle both `.class` and `.jar` files seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started with JavaDecompiler, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/releases). Download the file and execute it to start using the tool.

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK**: Ensure you have Java JDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Operating System**: This tool works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dzanaimamovic/JavaDecompiler/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded file to your desired location.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the extracted folder.
5. Run the following command to start the decompiler:

   ```bash
   java -jar JavaDecompiler.jar
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After launching the application, you can use the following commands to decompile your files:

- **Decompile a Single File**:

  ```bash
  java -jar JavaDecompiler.jar decompile path/to/yourfile.class
  ```

- **Decompile a JAR File**:

  ```bash
  java -jar JavaDecompiler.jar decompile path/to/yourfile.jar
  ```

- **Batch Decompile**:

  To decompile multiple files, use:

  ```bash
  java -jar JavaDecompiler.jar batch path/to/directory
  ```

### Options

You can customize your decompilation process with various options:

- `--output`: Specify the output directory for the decompiled files.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging of the decompilation process.
- `--help`: Display the help message with all available commands.

## Example

Here‚Äôs an example of how to decompile a JAR file:

1. Download the JAR file you want to decompile.
2. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar JavaDecompiler.jar decompile myproject.jar --output ./decompiled
   ```

This command will decompile `myproject.jar` and save the output in the `./decompiled` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using JavaDecompiler, consider the following steps:

- **Check Java Version**: Ensure you are using a compatible version of Java JDK.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the file paths you provide are correct.
- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read the files.
